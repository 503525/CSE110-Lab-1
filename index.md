# About Me!

## Who am I?

I'm an undergraduate student currently in my final year of the Mathematics / Computer Science program at UCSD.

## Current Projects:

1. Undergraduate Honors Thesis - Mathematics
   - The purpose of this thesis is to explore the properties of harmonic measures on simple convex regions of the complex plane. 
   -  Much of this investigation has been centered around the ways in which the curvature of the region's boundary affects the harmonic measure, both locally and globally.
   -  For more information on Harmonic Measures, check out [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn6jT5V9qW8).

    - *More details coming soon!*
